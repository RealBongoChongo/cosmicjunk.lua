# Introduction to Microcontrollers
## How They Work

These powerful components run luau code on the server which is very limited (meaning you cannot access the game objects or internal properties of objects).

    <strong style="color: #0ad;">WARNING</strong><br>
    Abusing this component will result in a very harsh ban if used to crash worlds or abuse vulnerabilities I may have missed
</blockquote><br>

However, you can still use this component to create a wide variety of tasks ranging from creating an interactable interface using the [Screen](https://realbongochongo.github.io/cosmicjunk.lua/docs/types/part/screen) component or creating a smart missile.

## Getting Started

You may want to get familiar with the global variables located [here](https://realbongochongo.github.io/cosmicjunk.lua/docs/basic/microcontroller)

To simply get started, you can read the documentation to the left side of the screen where there are many references and examples to use. I recommend using the [Getting Started Example](https://realbongochongo.github.io/cosmicjunk.lua/docs/examples/gettingstarted) to get an idea on how the microcontrollers function.
